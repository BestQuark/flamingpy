FlamingPy tutorials.

..
    To add a tutorial, use the ``gallery-item`` directive from the ``xanadu-sphinx-theme``
    Note that the ``description`` option can be a link to a document. Also,
    thumbnails will be created out of figures and stored in ``/_static/thumbs``.
    Therefore, consider ``/_static/thumbs`` as a "built" directory.

    **Example**

    .. gallery-item::
        :tooltip: This tutorial is directed at people who are new to FlamingPy.
        :figure: /_static/img/thumbnails/flamingpy.png
        :description: :doc:`/beginner/flamingpy_tutorial`

.. raw:: html

        <div style='clear:both'></div>
